Hi there,

My name is Darren and I am a passionate front end developer. I have decided to start a blog to detail down lessons I've learnt on my front end journey. This blog will be used to communicate problems I've encountered, report clever solutions and act as a reference point for myself and others in the future.


**Who am I?**

I am a Canberra local who graduated from ANU with a Bachelor's of Software Engineering (2016). My first role out of university was with the Department of Defence, and since then I have worked for Accenture and my current employer MTP Services. I have dabbled with a wide range of full stack technologies but my personal preference is working on front end development such as React.
